## 📦 Plugin Metadata

This plugin uses the [`plugin-yml.paper`](https://docs.eldoria.de/pluginyml/paper/) Gradle-DSL to automatically generate
the `paper-plugin.yml` at build time.

Example configuration in `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
paper {
    main = "de.mikeyllp.miniGamesV4.MiniGamesV4"
    apiVersion = "1.21"
    serverDependencies {
        register("CommandAPI") {
            required = true
            load = PaperPluginDescription.RelativeLoadOrder.BEFORE
        }
    }
}
```

This method avoids YAML files in the repo and ensures type-safe, automatic generation during each build.
